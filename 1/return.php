    <h1>Custom-Made Products Return Policy</h1>
    
    <div class="custom-notice">
        <h2>Important Custom Product Information</h2>
        <p>Custom-made products are created specifically for you and generally cannot be returned. Please read this policy carefully before ordering custom items.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Nature of Custom Products</h2>
    <p>Custom products are items made to your specifications, including personalized dimensions, colors, materials, designs, or engravings. Because these products are created specifically for you, they cannot be resold to other customers. This policy covers: custom furniture, personalized jewelry, made-to-order clothing, engraved items, custom artwork, specialty manufacturing, and any product modified to your specifications.</p>

    <div class="final-sale">
        <h3>Generally Final Sale</h3>
        <p>Most custom-made products are final sale and cannot be returned, exchanged, or refunded unless defective or substantially different from agreed specifications.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Approval Process</h2>
    <p>To minimize issues with custom products, we implement an approval process:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Design Confirmation:</strong> You approve design specifications before production begins</li>
        <li><strong>Material Samples:</strong> Physical or digital samples provided when possible</li>
        <li><strong>Production Updates:</strong> Progress photos or updates during manufacturing</li>
        <li><strong>Final Approval:</strong> Opportunity to request modifications before completion</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once you approve production to proceed, you accept responsibility for the custom nature of the product. Changes after approval may incur additional fees or may not be possible.</p>

    <h2>3. Refund Eligibility for Custom Products</h2>
    <p>Refunds for custom products are only available in these limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Manufacturer Defect:</strong> Product has material or workmanship defects</li>
        <li><strong>Substantial Deviation:</strong> Final product differs substantially from approved specifications</li>
        <li><strong>Failed Delivery:</strong> Product damaged beyond repair during shipping</li>
        <li><strong>Cancellation Before Production:</strong> Order cancelled before production begins</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Size or fit issues, color variations (within reasonable expectations), and minor differences from expectations are generally not grounds for refund.</p>

    <h2>4. Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <p>Cancellation of custom orders is subject to the following terms:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Cancellation Timing</th>
            <th>Refund Amount</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Before production begins</td>
            <td>100% minus design fees</td>
            <td>Design work completed is non-refundable</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>During production</td>
            <td>Up to 50%</td>
            <td>Based on materials purchased and work completed</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>After production completion</td>
            <td>0%</td>
            <td>Product cannot be resold</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>All cancellation requests must be submitted in writing. We will provide a cancellation quote based on work completed and materials purchased.</p>

    <h2>5. Measurement and Specification Responsibility</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for providing accurate measurements and specifications. We are not liable for products that don't fit or work as intended due to incorrect measurements provided by you. We recommend:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Double-checking all measurements before submission</li>
        <li>Consulting with our experts if unsure about measurements</li>
        <li>Providing photos or diagrams for complex specifications</li>
        <li>Approving all specifications in writing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may ask for clarification or suggest modifications if specifications seem problematic.</p>

    <h2>6. Material Variations</h2>
    <p>Natural materials (wood, stone, leather, fabric) have inherent variations in color, grain, and texture. These variations are not defects but characteristics of natural materials. We will provide samples when possible, but final products may vary from samples. Digital representations (photos, renderings) are approximate—actual products may differ slightly. If material consistency is critical, discuss this during design phase—alternative materials or selection processes may be available.</p>

    <h2>7. Production Timeline and Delays</h2>
    <p>Custom products have longer production times. Estimated timelines are provided but not guaranteed. Delays may occur due to material availability, craftsmanship requirements, or complexity. We will communicate delays and revised timelines. Delays alone are not grounds for cancellation or refund unless excessive (beyond 50% of estimated time) and not caused by client-requested changes.</p>

    <h2>8. Defective Custom Products</h2>
    <p>If you receive a defective custom product, contact us within 7 days of delivery. Provide photos showing the defect. We will determine whether the product can be repaired, replaced, or refunded. Repair or replacement is preferred for custom items. If replacement is chosen, production time applies. Refunds for defective custom products are limited to the purchase price—design time and customization are not refundable.</p>

    <h2>9. Modification Requests After Delivery</h2>
    <p>Modification requests after delivery are treated as new custom work and subject to additional charges. Shipping costs for returns for modification are your responsibility. We cannot guarantee all modifications are possible—some alterations may compromise structural integrity or appearance.</p>

    <h2>10. International Custom Orders</h2>
    <p>International custom orders are subject to additional considerations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shipping costs for returns are prohibitive—careful planning is essential</li>
        <li>Customs duties and taxes are your responsibility</li>
        <li>Communication may have time zone delays</li>
        <li>Measurements may need conversion—confirm units</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We recommend additional review stages for international custom orders.</p>

    <h2>11. Deposit and Payment Policy</h2>
    <p>Custom orders typically require a non-refundable deposit (usually 50%) to begin work. The balance is due before shipping. Deposits cover design time, material sourcing, and initial production. Deposits are only refundable if we cancel the order before production begins. Final payments are due upon completion—products will not ship until full payment is received.</p>

    <h2>12. Contact for Custom Product Issues</h2>
    <p>For custom product concerns, contact our custom products department with your order number and detailed information. The sooner you contact us about issues, the more options we have to resolve them.</p>
