    <h1>Crowdfunding Platform Terms and Conditions</h1>

    <div class="crowdfunding-notice">
        <h3>Crowdfunding Services Agreement</h3>
        <p>These Terms govern your use of our crowdfunding platform. We facilitate funding for projects but do not guarantee project success or delivery.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Platform Role and Services</h2>
    <p>Our platform provides crowdfunding services connecting project creators with backers. We act as an intermediary for funding transactions but are not a party to creator-backer agreements. Creators launch campaigns to raise funds for projects, products, or causes. Backers contribute funds in exchange for rewards, products, or support. We provide technology for campaign creation, payment processing, and communication. We do not evaluate project feasibility, manage projects, or guarantee outcomes. Creators are responsible for project execution and reward fulfillment. Backers assume risks associated with supporting projects. Our role is limited to platform operation and transaction facilitation. We may offer additional services like marketing or consulting for fees.</p>

    <div class="risk-box">
        <h4>Crowdfunding Risks Notice</h4>
        <p>CROWDFUNDING INVOLVES RISKS: Projects may fail, be delayed, or not deliver as promised. Backers may not receive rewards. Creators may misuse funds. There are no guarantees. Only contribute amounts you can afford to lose. Research creators thoroughly before backing.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Creator Responsibilities and Obligations</h2>
    <p>Creators must provide accurate project information, realistic funding goals, and feasible timelines. Creators are legally obligated to fulfill rewards or provide refunds if unable to deliver. Campaign content must be truthful and not misleading. Creators must communicate regularly with backers about progress, challenges, and changes. Funds must be used for stated project purposes. Creators must comply with all applicable laws including tax, consumer protection, and product safety regulations. Intellectual property rights must be respected. Creators may not offer financial returns or equity unless compliant with securities laws. Failure to fulfill obligations may result in legal action from backers and platform suspension. We may require identity verification for creators.</p>

    <h2>3. Backer Responsibilities and Expectations</h2>
    <p>Backers voluntarily contribute to projects understanding the risks. Contributions are not purchases—they are support for projects with promised rewards. Backers should research creators, read campaign details, and understand risks before contributing. Reward estimates are not guarantees. Backers may not receive rewards if projects fail. Contributions are generally non-refundable unless creators fail to deliver without justification. Backers should monitor project updates and communicate with creators. Tax implications of contributions are the backer's responsibility. Backers must use valid payment methods and provide accurate shipping information. Chargebacks without attempting resolution may result in account suspension. Backers should report suspicious campaigns.</p>

    <h2>4. Funding Models and Payouts</h2>
    <p>We may offer different funding models: all-or-nothing (funds only released if goal met) or flexible (funds released regardless). Model terms are specified per campaign. Funds are held in escrow during campaigns. Payouts to creators occur after campaign completion minus fees and after any holding periods. Some funds may be held for risk management. Payout schedules and methods vary. Creators receive funds net of payment processing fees and platform fees. International transactions may involve currency conversion and additional fees. Backer payments are processed immediately but may be refunded if campaigns fail or are cancelled. We reserve the right to withhold funds for compliance, risk, or legal reasons.</p>

    <h2>5. Fees and Payment Processing</h2>
    <p>Platform fees are deducted from funds raised. Fee structure is disclosed during campaign creation and may vary by campaign type or location. Payment processing fees are additional and set by payment processors. Fees are non-refundable once campaigns succeed. Failed campaigns may have reduced or no fees. We may offer promotional fee structures occasionally. Creators see fee breakdown before launch. Backers may see fees added to contributions. Fee changes for existing campaigns require notice. International fees may include currency conversion charges. Tax obligations are separate from fees. We use third-party payment processors subject to their terms.</p>

    <h2>6. Campaign Content and Approval</h2>
    <p>Campaigns must comply with our content guidelines and prohibited items list. We review campaigns but do not guarantee approval or verify claims. Prohibited items include: illegal products, weapons, drugs, adult content, hate speech, or misleading claims. Campaigns must have clear goals, realistic funding targets, and feasible reward structures. We may reject or remove campaigns violating policies. Creators must respond to review inquiries. Campaign content may be edited before or after launch for compliance. We are not responsible for campaign content accuracy. Backers should report inappropriate campaigns. Campaign suspension may occur for policy violations.</p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
    <p>Creators retain intellectual property rights to their projects but grant backers license to rewards as specified. Campaign content must not infringe others' rights. Creators are responsible for obtaining necessary licenses and permissions. Backers receive rewards as specified but do not gain project ownership unless stated. We may use campaign content for platform promotion. Copyright infringement claims should follow DMCA procedures. Trademark usage must be authorized. Patents and trade secrets remain with creators. Reward designs may be subject to intellectual property limitations. We respect intellectual property rights and remove infringing content.</p>

    <2>8. Communication and Updates</h2>
    <p>Creators must provide regular updates to backers: during campaigns, after funding, during production, and after delivery. Update frequency expectations are set during campaign creation. Backers should subscribe to updates and check campaign pages. Communication tools are provided but we are not responsible for creator communication. Backers can message creators through platform. Disputes should first be addressed through direct communication. We may facilitate communication but are not mediators. Creator responsiveness affects reputation. Failed communication may indicate project problems. Backers should report non-communicative creators.</p>

    <h2>9. Refund and Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>Refund policies depend on campaign terms and creator obligations. Generally, contributions are not refundable unless creators fail to deliver without justification. Disputes between creators and backers should be resolved directly. We may provide dispute resolution tools but are not obligated to mediate. Legal remedies are available for breaches. Chargebacks should be last resort after attempted resolution. Excessive chargebacks may result in account restrictions. We may withhold funds during disputes. Refund requests must be submitted with evidence. Creators may offer refunds voluntarily. Failed projects may result in partial or no refunds depending on circumstances.</p>

    <h2>10. Prohibited Activities and Enforcement</h2>
    <p>Prohibited activities include: fraud, misrepresentation, fund misuse, illegal activities, harassment, spam, multiple accounts, fee evasion, or policy violations. We may investigate and take action: warnings, campaign suspension, account termination, fund withholding, or legal reporting. Enforcement considers evidence and severity. Appeals may be available. We cooperate with law enforcement. Creators may face legal action from backers for fraud. We may require documentation for fund release. Suspicious activity triggers review. Repeated violations result in permanent bans.</p>

    <h2>11. Tax and Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>Tax obligations are the responsibility of creators and backers. Funds raised may be taxable income. Reward values may have tax implications. We may report transactions as required by law. Creators must comply with product safety, consumer protection, and business regulations. International campaigns must respect local laws. Securities offerings require compliance with regulations. We are not tax or legal advisors—consult professionals. Documentation may be required for legal compliance. We may request tax information for payout processing. Legal disputes are between creators and backers.</p>

    <h2>12. Disclaimer of Crowdfunding Warranties</h2>
    <p>PLATFORM AND CAMPAIGNS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE: PROJECT SUCCESS, REWARD DELIVERY, CREATOR PERFORMANCE, OR INVESTMENT RETURNS. BACKING INVOLVES RISKS.
