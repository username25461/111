    <h2>Payment Security Protocols</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures for payment processing, including SSL encryption, tokenization, and compliance with PCI DSS standards. All payment transactions are processed through accredited payment service providers that maintain their own privacy policies. We do not have access to or store complete payment card information on our systems.</p>

    <h2>Shipping and Fulfillment Partners</h2>
    <p>We share necessary shipping information with logistics partners solely for delivery purposes. These partners are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for order fulfillment. Tracking information may be shared with you directly through our platform or via carrier notifications.</p>

    <h2>Marketing Communications</h2>
    <p>With your consent, we may send promotional emails about new products, special offers, or other information we think you may find interesting. You may opt out of marketing communications at any time by using the unsubscribe link in our emails or adjusting your account preferences. Transactional communications related to your orders will continue regardless of marketing preferences.</p>

    <h2>Return and Refund Processing</h2>
    <p>When processing returns and refunds, we collect information about the reason for return, product condition, and original transaction details. This information is used to process refunds, improve product quality, and prevent fraudulent returns.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
    <p>We engage various service providers including payment processors, shipping carriers, customer support platforms, and analytics services. Each provider is carefully vetted and bound by contractual agreements that require them to implement appropriate security measures and use data only for specified purposes.</p>

    <h2>Your Shopping Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>You can access and update your account information, order history, and communication preferences through your account settings. You may request export of your transaction history or deletion of your account subject to legal retention requirements for financial records.</p>
