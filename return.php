    <h1>Clothing and Apparel Return Policy</h1>
    
    <div class="clothing-notice">
        <h2>Clothing Return Guidelines</h2>
        <p>Clothing returns require special attention to hygiene and condition. Please review this policy before returning apparel items.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Clothing Return Eligibility</h2>
    <p>Clothing and apparel may be returned within 30 days of delivery, provided they meet strict condition requirements. Due to hygiene considerations, we cannot resell clothing that has been worn, altered, or shows signs of use. Always try on clothing over your own undergarments and on clean surfaces.</p>

    <div class="hygiene-box">
        <h3>Hygiene Requirements</h3>
        <p>All returned clothing must be in hygienic, unworn condition. Items with odors, stains, makeup, deodorant marks, or pet hair cannot be accepted for return or exchange.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Condition Requirements for Clothing Returns</h2>
    <p>Returned clothing must be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unworn, unwashed, and unaltered</li>
        <li>With all original tags attached and intact</li>
        <li>Free of odors, stains, or residues</li>
        <li>In original packaging when applicable</li>
        <li>Without any signs of try-on wear</li>
        <li>All buttons, zippers, and fasteners intact</li>
        <li>No perfume, deodorant, or makeup transfer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We inspect all clothing returns thoroughly. Items failing inspection will be returned to you at your expense.</p>

    <h2>3. Try-On Guidelines</h2>
    <p>To ensure return eligibility, follow these try-on guidelines:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash hands before handling clothing</li>
        <li>Try on over your own undergarments</li>
        <li>Use clean, dry surfaces (not carpets)</li>
        <li>Remove jewelry that could snag fabric</li>
        <li>Avoid trying on while wearing makeup or lotions</li>
        <li>Keep tags outside clothing during try-on</li>
        <li>Do not force items that clearly don't fit</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Following these guidelines preserves clothing condition for possible return.</p>
