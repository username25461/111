    <h1>Digital Products Return Policy</h1>
    
    <div class="digital-notice">
        <h2>Important Digital Product Information</h2>
        <p>Due to the nature of digital products, returns and refunds are limited. Please read this policy carefully before purchasing digital products.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Digital Product Nature</h2>
    <p>Digital products are intangible goods delivered electronically. Once accessed, downloaded, or streamed, they cannot be physically returned. This includes but is not limited to: software, e-books, digital music, video content, online courses, downloadable templates, mobile applications, and subscription-based digital services. Because digital products can be duplicated, our return policy is designed to protect intellectual property while being fair to customers.</p>

    <div class="non-refundable">
        <h3>Generally Non-Refundable</h3>
        <p>Most digital product purchases are final and non-refundable once the product has been accessed, downloaded, or streamed. This is standard industry practice to prevent unauthorized copying and distribution.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Refund Eligibility Exceptions</h2>
    <p>Despite the general non-refundable nature of digital products, we may issue refunds in the following exceptional circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> The product is defective or doesn't work as described despite meeting system requirements</li>
        <li><strong>Accidental Purchase:</strong> Duplicate purchase or accidental purchase, provided no access has occurred</li>
        <li><strong>Unauthorized Purchase:</strong> Fraudulent use of payment method, verified through proper channels</li>
        <li><strong>Substantial Misrepresentation:</strong> The product differs substantially from its description</li>
        <li><strong>Failed Delivery:</strong> Product not delivered due to technical errors on our part</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All refund requests must be submitted within 14 days of purchase and include detailed explanation and supporting evidence.</p>

    <h2>3. Software and Application Returns</h2>
    <p>Software and application purchases are generally non-refundable once the license key has been revealed or the software has been downloaded. However, we may consider refunds if:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The software is fundamentally defective and doesn't run on systems meeting minimum requirements</li>
        <li>The software differs substantially from its advertised features</li>
        <li>You purchase the wrong version and haven't downloaded or activated it</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Before requesting a software refund, please contact technical support for assistance. Many issues can be resolved through troubleshooting. Trial versions are available for most software to test compatibility.</p>

    <h2>4. Digital Content and Media</h2>
    <p>Digital content including e-books, music, videos, and other media are non-refundable once accessed or downloaded. We provide samples, previews, or free chapters whenever possible to help you make informed decisions. If you experience playback issues, please contact support for assistance—most technical issues can be resolved. Refunds for digital content will only be considered if the files are corrupted and cannot be replaced with working versions.</p>

    <h2>5. Online Courses and Educational Content</h2>
    <p>Online courses and educational content have specific refund policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Before Access:</strong> Full refund if requested before course materials are accessed</li>
        <li><strong>Within 7 Days:</strong> Partial refund if less than 25% of course content has been accessed</li>
        <li><strong>After 7 Days:</strong> Generally non-refundable after significant content access</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> Refund or course extension if technical issues prevent access</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Course completion certificates may be revoked if a refund is issued. Bundle purchases must be refunded in full—partial refunds of bundles are not available.</p>

    <h2>6. Subscription Services</h2>
    <p>Subscription-based digital services may be cancelled at any time, but refunds for unused portions are generally not provided. When you cancel a subscription, you will continue to have access until the end of your current billing period. Refunds for subscription services may be considered if:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You were charged after cancelling</li>
        <li>You were charged multiple times for the same period</li>
        <li>The service was substantially unavailable during your billing period</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Free trial conversions to paid subscriptions are refundable if cancelled within the trial period terms.</p>

    <h2>7. License Key Issues</h2>
    <p>If you purchase a license key that doesn't work, please contact support with your purchase details and the error message received. We will verify the key and issue a replacement if defective. Refunds for license keys are only available if we cannot provide a working replacement key. Used or activated license keys cannot be refunded as they cannot be resold.</p>

    <h2>8. Accidental and Duplicate Purchases</h2>
    <p>If you accidentally purchase the same digital product twice or purchase the wrong product, contact us immediately. If you haven't accessed the product, we may be able to cancel the order or issue a refund. Provide both order numbers and explanation. Duplicate purchases discovered after product access are generally not refundable.</p>

    <h2>9. Refund Processing for Digital Products</h2>
    <p>Approved refunds for digital products are processed as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Refunds issued to original payment method</li>
        <li>Processing time: 5-10 business days</li>
        <li>Access to product revoked upon refund approval</li>
        <li>License keys deactivated</li>
        <li>Account access to content removed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Continued use of digital products after refund approval may constitute unauthorized use and violate copyright laws.</p>

    <h2>10. Chargebacks and Disputes</h2>
    <p>Filing a chargeback without first contacting us to resolve issues may result in permanent account suspension and legal action to recover costs. We incur significant fees for chargebacks, and we actively dispute unjustified chargebacks. If you have issues with a digital product, please contact us first—we are usually able to resolve problems to your satisfaction.</p>

    <h2>11. Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>This digital return policy may be updated periodically. The policy in effect at the time of purchase governs that purchase. We recommend reviewing this policy before each digital purchase.</p>

    <h2>12. Contact for Digital Returns</h2>
    <p>For digital product return inquiries, contact our digital support team through the designated channels. Have your order number, product name, and details of the issue ready.</p>
