    <h1>Environmental Platform Terms and Conditions</h1>

    <div class="environment-notice">
        <h3>Environmental Services Agreement</h3>
        <p>These Terms govern your use of our environmental platform. We provide environmental information and tools but do not provide regulatory compliance advice.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Platform Services and Purpose</h2>
    <p>Our platform provides environmental-related services including: sustainability tracking, carbon footprint calculation, environmental education, green product information, community initiatives, and environmental data visualization. Services are designed to increase environmental awareness and promote sustainable practices. We provide information and tools but do not guarantee environmental outcomes. Data and calculations are estimates based on available information. We are not environmental consultants or regulatory advisors. Information should not be used for compliance reporting without verification. Platform features may include community projects, challenges, and educational content. We partner with environmental organizations but do not endorse all partner activities.</p>

    <div class="impact-box">
        <h4>Environmental Impact Disclaimer</h4>
        <p>Environmental calculations are estimates only. Actual environmental impacts may vary. Carbon footprint calculations use standard conversion factors that may not reflect specific circumstances. Sustainability claims should be verified with primary sources. Regulatory compliance requires professional consultation.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Environmental Data and Calculations</h2>
    <p>Environmental data comes from various sources including government databases, research institutions, and third-party providers. Data accuracy depends on source quality and update frequency. We aggregate and present data but do not verify all data points. Calculations (carbon, water, waste) use standardized methodologies that may not suit specific situations. Results are approximations for educational purposes. Do not use calculations for legal compliance or financial reporting without professional verification. Data visualizations simplify complex information—consult original sources for detailed analysis. We strive for data accuracy but cannot guarantee error-free information.</p>

    <h2>3. Sustainability Tracking and Reporting</h2>
    <p>Sustainability tracking features monitor environmental metrics over time. Tracking accuracy depends on your input data. We provide tools but not auditing services. Self-reported data may contain errors or omissions. Tracking results are for personal or organizational awareness, not certification. We may generate reports or certificates of participation—these are not official certifications. Environmental certifications require third-party verification. Use tracking to identify improvement opportunities, not as proof of performance. Share tracking results responsibly without misrepresenting achievements.</p>

    <h2>4. Community Initiatives and Projects</h2>
    <p>We may facilitate community environmental projects, cleanups, or initiatives. Participation is voluntary. Follow safety guidelines during activities. We are not liable for injuries or damages during community events. Project organizers are responsible for event management. Verify organizer credentials if concerned. Some projects may involve physical activity or outdoor risks—participate at your own risk. Community features allow user interaction—be respectful and constructive. Report inappropriate behavior. User-organized projects are not endorsed by us unless specifically stated.</p>

    <h2>5. Green Product and Service Information</h2>
    <p>Product and service information includes environmental attributes, certifications, and sustainability claims. Information is provided by manufacturers or third parties. We do not verify all claims or product performance. Green certifications vary in rigor—research certification standards. Product recommendations are based on available information, not comprehensive testing. We may receive compensation for featured products—this is disclosed when required. Environmental benefits depend on usage patterns and disposal methods. Consider entire product lifecycle, not just use phase. Consult independent sources for product evaluations.</p>

    <h2>6. Educational Content and Resources</h2>
    <p>Environmental education content covers various topics: climate change, conservation, renewable energy, waste management, etc. Content is for informational purposes only. Scientific understanding evolves—content may become outdated. We present consensus views when possible but acknowledge scientific debates. Content may include opinions or perspectives—evaluate critically. Educational resources complement but do not replace formal education. Some content may be suitable for classroom use—verify appropriateness. We strive for accuracy but recommend consulting multiple sources for important decisions.</p>

    <h2>7. Carbon Offset and Credit Programs</h2>
    <p>If we offer carbon offset or credit programs, these involve third-party projects. We facilitate transactions but do not manage offset projects. Offset quality varies—research project standards and verification. Carbon credits represent emissions reductions, not necessarily elimination. Offset purchases do not justify increased emissions. We disclose project details and standards to the extent available. Financial contributions to offset projects may be tax-deductible—consult tax professionals. Offset effectiveness depends on project additionality and permanence. We are not responsible for project failures or invalid credits.</p>

    <h2>8. Regulatory Compliance Information</h2>
    <p>We may provide information about environmental regulations but this is not legal advice. Regulations vary by jurisdiction and change frequently. Compliance information is general and may not reflect local requirements. Consult environmental attorneys or consultants for compliance matters. We are not responsible for regulatory violations based on platform information. Some features may help track compliance requirements but do not guarantee compliance. Use information as starting point for professional consultation. Report regulatory updates through appropriate channels.</p>

    <h2>9. User-Generated Content and Contributions</h2>
    <p>Users may contribute environmental data, project reports, or community content. You retain ownership but grant license for platform use. Ensure contributions are accurate and not misleading. Do not submit confidential or proprietary information. Contributions may be visible to other users. We moderate contributions but cannot review all content. Report inaccurate or inappropriate contributions. User content represents contributor views, not official positions. We may use anonymized contributions for research and platform improvement.</p>

    <h2>10. Partnerships and Third-Party Organizations</h2>
    <p>We partner with environmental organizations, nonprofits, and businesses. Partnerships are disclosed when relevant. We do not endorse all partner activities or positions. Partner content may appear on our platform—evaluate independently. Financial relationships with partners are disclosed when required. Partnerships may involve data sharing—review privacy policies. We screen partners but cannot guarantee their performance or ethics. Report concerns about partners directly to them. Partnerships may change without notice.</p>

    <h2>11. Intellectual Property and Data Usage</h2>
    <p>Platform content, tools, and data visualizations are protected intellectual property. You receive limited license for personal use. Environmental data from public sources may have usage restrictions. Respect data licensing terms. User contributions grant us license for platform operation. Do not misuse platform data for commercial purposes without permission. Report intellectual property concerns. We respect others' intellectual property rights.</p>

    <h2>12. Disclaimer of Environmental Warranties</h2>
    <p>PLATFORM AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE: ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES, DATA ACCURACY, CALCULATION PRECISION, OR REGULATORY COMPLIANCE. ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION IS ESTIMATED AND GENERAL. NO PROFESSIONAL ADVICE IS PROVIDED. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL DECISIONS OR CONSEQUENCES. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION CREATES WARRANTIES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW WARRANTY EXCLUSIONS.</p>

    <h2>13. Limitation of Liability for Environmental Services</h2>
    <p>OUR LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR: ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGES, REGULATORY VIOLATIONS, FINANCIAL LOSSES, OR PERSONAL INJURY. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED FEES PAID. WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES EVEN IF WE KNEW ABOUT POSSIBLE DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIABILITY LIMITATIONS. NOTHING LIMITS LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.</p>

    <h2>14. Indemnification for Environmental Activities</h2>
    <p>You agree to defend and indemnify us against claims arising from your environmental activities. This includes claims related to: your environmental projects, your data submissions, your community interactions, your violations, or harm caused. You are responsible for damages we incur. This obligation survives account termination. We may assume defense, and you must cooperate. You may not settle without our consent. Indemnification covers our employees, directors, and affiliates.</p>

    <h2>15. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by applicable jurisdiction laws. Disputes should first be addressed through customer support. Unresolved disputes may be subject to binding arbitration. Class actions and jury trials are waived. Small claims court may be available. Environmental disputes may involve specialized forums. We may modify dispute terms with notice. Continued use constitutes acceptance.</p>
