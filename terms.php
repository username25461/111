        <h3>Educational Services Agreement</h3>
        <p>These Terms govern your use of our educational platform, courses, and learning materials. By accessing our educational content, you agree to these Terms.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Educational Services Description</h2>
    <p>We provide an online educational platform that offers courses, learning materials, assessments, and educational resources ("Educational Content"). The specific courses, materials, and features available may vary and are subject to change. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the Educational Content for your personal, non-commercial educational purposes. This license does not permit you to share your account or access with others, redistribute Educational Content, or use the Educational Content for any commercial purpose. Some Educational Content may be available for a limited time period, and access may expire according to the course terms or your enrollment period. We reserve the right to modify, update, or discontinue any Educational Content at any time without notice.</p>

    <p>Course enrollment may require payment of fees as indicated during the enrollment process. Upon enrollment, you will receive access to the course materials for the specified access period. Some courses may have prerequisites that must be met before enrollment. We reserve the right to refuse enrollment or terminate access if we determine that you do not meet the prerequisites or have violated these Terms. Course materials are provided for educational purposes only and do not constitute professional advice or certification unless specifically stated.</p>

    <h2>3. Academic Integrity and Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree to maintain academic integrity in all your activities on the platform. This includes, but is not limited to: (a) completing your own work and assessments; (b) not engaging in plagiarism or unauthorized collaboration; (c) not sharing assessment questions or answers with others; (d) not using unauthorized materials during assessments; (e) not impersonating another student or allowing someone else to impersonate you; (f) not submitting work that is not your own; (g) not engaging in any form of cheating or academic dishonesty. Violations of academic integrity may result in immediate termination of your access to the platform, revocation of any certificates earned, and prohibition from future enrollment. We reserve the right to investigate any suspected violations of academic integrity and take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>4. Certificates and Credentials</h2>
    <p>Upon successful completion of a course that offers a certificate, you may receive a digital certificate or credential. Certificates are issued based on meeting all course requirements, including assessment scores and participation criteria. Certificates are not academic degrees and do not confer any academic credit unless specifically stated. We reserve the right to revoke certificates if we later determine that the requirements were not met or if there was a violation of these Terms. Certificates may include your name, course title, completion date, and verification information. You may share your certificates on social media or professional networks, but you may not alter or modify them. We do not guarantee that any employer, educational institution, or other organization will recognize or accept our certificates.</p>

    <h2>5. Student Work and Assignments</h2>
    <p>When you submit assignments, projects, or other student work ("Student Work") through the platform, you retain ownership of your Student Work. However, by submitting Student Work, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, and display your Student Work for the purpose of operating and improving the platform, including for educational and research purposes. You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to grant this license and that your Student Work does not infringe any third-party rights. We may use Student Work in anonymized or aggregated form for research, platform improvement, or promotional purposes. Peer review assignments may involve sharing your Student Work with other students in the same course.</p>

    <h2>6. Discussion Forums and Community Guidelines</h2>
    <p>The platform may include discussion forums, chat rooms, or other community features where students can interact. You agree to follow our community guidelines when using these features: (a) be respectful and constructive in your communications; (b) do not post inappropriate, offensive, or harassing content; (c) do not share personal information about yourself or others; (d) do not post spam, advertisements, or promotional content; (e) do not share answers to assessments or graded assignments; (f) do not post copyrighted material without permission; (g) do not impersonate instructors, staff, or other students. We may monitor community discussions and remove any content that violates these guidelines. We are not responsible for content posted by other users in community features.</p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property in Educational Content</h2>
    <p>All Educational Content, including course materials, videos, text, graphics, logos, and software, is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, republish, download, store, or transmit any Educational Content, except as follows: (a) you may download or print reasonable copies of materials for your personal educational use; (b) you may share links to publicly available course pages; (c) you may use the platform's sharing features where available. You may not record, stream, or redistribute live sessions without permission. Commercial use of Educational Content is strictly prohibited.</p>

    <h2>8. Instructor-Student Relationship</h2>
    <p>Our platform facilitates educational interactions between students and instructors. Instructors are independent contractors or employees who create and deliver Educational Content. While instructors may provide guidance and feedback, they are not providing personalized tutoring or guaranteed individual attention unless specifically offered as part of a course feature. Instructors may set their own office hours, response times, and interaction policies. We are not responsible for the content of instructor communications or the quality of instruction provided by individual instructors. Disputes between students and instructors should be addressed through the platform's support channels.</p>

    <h2>9. Technical Requirements and Support</h2>
    <p>To access the platform and Educational Content, you need a compatible device, internet connection, and up-to-date web browser. Some courses may have additional technical requirements, such as specific software or hardware. We provide technical support for platform access issues but do not provide support for your personal devices or internet connection. We recommend testing your system before enrolling in courses that have specific technical requirements. We are not responsible for any technical issues that prevent you from accessing or completing courses, including internet outages, device failures, or compatibility issues.</p>

    <h2>10. Refund Policy for Courses</h2>
    <p>Refund policies vary by course and enrollment type. Generally, refunds may be available within a specified period after enrollment if you have not accessed significant course materials. To request a refund, you must contact support and provide your enrollment information. Refunds are issued to the original payment method and may take several business days to process. Some courses may have no-refund policies, which will be clearly stated during enrollment. If we cancel a course, you will receive a full refund. Refunds are not available for partially completed courses or for failure to complete a course within the access period.</p>

    <h2>11. Privacy of Student Records</h2>
    <p>We maintain the privacy of your student records in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable laws. Your course progress, assessment scores, and completion status are considered educational records. We may share aggregated, anonymized data about student performance for research or platform improvement purposes. We do not share individual student records with third parties except as required by law or with your consent. If you are accessing the platform through an educational institution, additional privacy terms may apply as specified in our agreement with that institution.</p>

    <h2>12. Disclaimer of Educational Outcomes</h2>
    <p>WE DO NOT GUARANTEE ANY SPECIFIC EDUCATIONAL OR CAREER OUTCOMES FROM USING OUR PLATFORM OR COMPLETING OUR COURSES. THE EDUCATIONAL CONTENT IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR USEFULNESS OF THE EDUCATIONAL CONTENT. COMPLETION OF COURSES DOES NOT GUARANTEE EMPLOYMENT, PROMOTION, SALARY INCREASE, OR ANY OTHER SPECIFIC RESULT. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR USE OF THE EDUCATIONAL CONTENT AND ANY DECISIONS OR ACTIONS YOU TAKE BASED ON IT.</p>

    <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE PLATFORM; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE PLATFORM; (C) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE PLATFORM; AND (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.</p>

    <h2>14. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us and our affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with: (a) your access to or use of the platform or Educational Content; (b) your violation of these Terms; (c) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property, or privacy right; or (d) any claim that your Student Work caused damage to a third party.</p>

    <h2>15. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email or through the platform. Your continued use of the platform after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop using the platform. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically for updates.</p>
