You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment and ancillary services needed to connect to, access, or otherwise use the service, including, without limitation, modems, hardware, servers, software, operating systems, networking, web servers, and the like.

By submitting your data to the service, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, process, and store your data solely for the purpose of providing the service to you. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. You are solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and appropriateness of your data. We may monitor and analyze your use of the service for purposes of improving the service, providing support, and ensuring compliance with these Terms.</p>

    <h2>5. Service Level Agreement</h2>
    <p>We will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the service available with an uptime of 99.5% each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance. Scheduled maintenance will be performed during non-peak hours whenever possible, and we will provide reasonable advance notice of scheduled maintenance that may result in service downtime. We do not guarantee that the service will be uninterrupted or error-free, nor do we make any warranty as to the results that may be obtained from use of the service. In the event of service unavailability exceeding the guaranteed uptime, your sole and exclusive remedy shall be a service credit as described in our SLA documentation.

The receiving party will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any confidential information of the disclosing party, except as necessary to perform its obligations or exercise its rights under these Terms. Confidential information shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes publicly known through no act or omission of the receiving party; (b) was in the receiving party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure; (c) is lawfully disclosed to the receiving party by a third party without restriction on disclosure; (d) is independently developed by the receiving party.

    <p>We retain all right, title, and interest in and to the service, including all related intellectual property rights. The service is protected by applicable intellectual property laws, including copyright and trademark laws. These Terms do not grant you any intellectual property license or rights in or to the service or any of its components, except for the limited access rights expressly set forth in these Terms.

    <h2>8. Termination and Suspension</h2>

We may suspend your access to the service immediately if: (a) we reasonably believe you are violating these Terms; (b) we detect malicious software connected to your account; (c) we are required to do so by law; (d) there is unusual activity in your account that we reasonably believe may result in harm to our systems or other users. Upon termination, your right to use the service will immediately cease.

The following sections will survive termination: Intellectual Property Rights, Confidentiality, Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, and General Provisions.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Export and Migration</h2>
    <p>During the subscription term, you may export your data from the service using the export tools we provide. We recommend that you regularly export and backup your data. Following termination of your subscription, we will retain your data for a period of 30 days to allow you to retrieve it. After this period, we may delete your data from our systems. We are not responsible for any loss of data resulting from termination or suspension. If you require assistance with data migration, we may offer professional services at additional cost, subject to separate agreement.</p>

    <h2>10. Third-Party Integrations</h2>
    <p>The service may contain features designed to interoperate with third-party applications. To use such features, you may be required to obtain access to such third-party applications from their providers. We cannot guarantee the continued availability of such service features and may cease providing them without notice if the third-party provider ceases to make the third-party application available for interoperation with the corresponding service features. You are responsible for complying with any third-party terms applicable to such integrations. We are not responsible for any disclosure, modification, or deletion of your data resulting from access by such third-party applications.</p>

    <h2>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, THAT THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICE WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, THAT THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL PURCHASED OR OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS, OR THAT ANY ERRORS IN THE SERVICE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM US OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.</p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU HEREUNDER IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE INCIDENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL WE HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

    <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to: (a) your use of the service; (b) your violation of these Terms; (c) your violation of any rights of any third party; (d) any content or data you submit, post, transmit, or otherwise make available through the service; or (e) your violation of any applicable laws or regulations. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.</p>

    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the applicable jurisdiction, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights under these Terms without your consent.
