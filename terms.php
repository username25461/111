    <div class="media-notice">
        <h3>Media Services Agreement</h3>
        <p>These Terms govern your use of our news and media platform. We provide news content and media services but do not guarantee accuracy or completeness.</p>

    <h2>1. Platform Content and Services</h2>
    <p>Our platform provides news articles, multimedia content, opinion pieces, analysis, and media services. Content comes from various sources: staff journalists, wire services, contributors, and syndicated content. We strive for accuracy but cannot guarantee error-free content. News evolves rapidly—information may change after publication. We correct significant errors when identified. Content represents various perspectives—not all views are endorsed. Some content may be opinion or analysis rather than factual reporting. We differentiate between news and opinion content. Media services may include video, audio, and interactive features. Content availability may vary by region due to licensing.</p>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h4>Content Disclaimer</h4>
        <p>News content is for informational purposes only. Verify important information with primary sources. Breaking news may contain inaccuracies. Opinion content represents author views, not institutional positions. Do not make significant decisions based solely on news content.</p>
    </div>
